# Concept

## Vision

Atmos transforms real-time weather data into a holographic, audio-visual installation, creating a multi-sensory experience that blends science, technology, and art.

## Mission

- To reimagine weather by integrating light, and sound.
- To bridge data and art, making it engaging and intuitive.
- To create an immersive space where people can see, and hear the weather.

## Values

- Futuristic – Pushing boundaries with real-time visuals.
- Immersion – Experiencing through light, sound, and holography.
- Connectivity – Linking differet physical devices into one network.

## Users & User Needs

### Personas

To define the **Target users**, **Proto Personas** were used. These are based on **assumptions rather than on user research**. The selected Personas have a **narrow scope** and focus on the **specific product** instead of representing users across multiple products.

The following **framework** was used to describe each persona:

- **Name, age, gender, and a photo**
- **Tagline describing what they do**
- **Experience level**
- **Context of interaction**
- **Goals and concerns**
- **A direct quote**

### User Stories

To define the **User Needs**, **user stories** were used. Each user story follows the **as a [persona], I [want to], [so that]**.

## Main Goal

The main goal of **Atmos** is to allow users to **experience real-time weather data** in a way that is **engaging, immersive, and artistic** without the use of numbers as a value. It should create an environment where users can feel like they are truly experiencing the **weather** through **visuals** and **sounds**.

This goal should be achieved within the **10 weeks** of the IOT Program.

## Product Requirements

The product requirements ensure that **Atmos** meets the user expectations. Each of these product requirement features should be fully functional by **week 10**.

### Real-Time Weather Visualization

Visuals, lighting, and sound must update within 5 seconds of weather changes.

### Intuitive User Experience

Experience must feel natural, intuitive, and technologically innovative.

### Event Customization & Remote Control

Remote control via a web interface, with settings stored via API/database.

### Scalability & Replicability

The system must be modular, scalable, and well-documented for replication.
